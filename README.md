# EmailChecker

Simple library checking the validity of an email. Checks are performed in the
following order:

* REGEX: validate the emails has a good looking format
* MX: validate the domain sever contains MX records
* SMTP: validate the SMTP behind the MX records knows this email address (no
email sent)

:warning: That's rare but, some SMTP define a catchall email address. Meaning
all emails using this domain seems valid even if they are not.

### Usage

```elixir
EmailChecker.valid?("kevin@disneur.me")
#=> true
EmailChecker.valid?("non-existing@disneur.me")
#=> false
```
